# Telegram Bot: Get Companies

This Telegram bot was developed by me and my outsourcing team to streamline corporate routine processes for management in a private company.

### Key Features:
- Communicates with the companyâ€™s data storage via **Google API**
- Supports **CRUD operations** for managing data
- Stores and processes custom requests from managers

### Tech Stack:
- **Python** (using `python-telegram-bot` library)
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM for database operations
- **Docker** for containerization

### Architecture:
The bot follows a classical bot architecture, designed to support both **CRUD operations** and **custom requests**, allowing managers to streamline processes efficiently.

### Repository:
Due to the ongoing development and sensitive information, I am unable to provide direct access to the original GitHub repository. However, I have attached a copy of the repository with sensitive details removed.

This project showcases the power of **python-telegram-bot** combined with **PostgreSQL** and **SQLAlchemy**, and serves as a practical example of integrating a Telegram bot into corporate management workflows.
